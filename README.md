DESIGN A POKEDEX CHALLENGE

Introduction
This project challenges us to use all the skills we have learned to date and apply it to designing a working pokedex.

Outline
I started by creating a wireframe that would dictate how my page would look like. I amended it multiple times during the course of the project as and when I updated anything. I ended with a very basic wireframe.

Requirements
My version of pokedex were cards that displayed the designated pokemon information. Some of the key requirements were:
    - create at least 3 pokemons with information such as their hp, attack, properties etc.
    - link to the pokemon api to get this information
    - store each pokemon in an object, which has the above-mentioned properties
    - store these objects inb  another object (named your trainer name, in this case 'gunn')
       -  have a method named 'all' that accepts no param and returns an array of pokemon objects
    -  another method named 'get' that accepts a param (name) and returns info on pokemon
    - use ajax call to retrieve the pokemon info
    - have css code in sass
    - use materialize as grid

Challenges
I Googled a lot of information, which was helpful but also received a huge amount of help. It was a true learning project in that I learned how little I knew, yet again.

My main challenge was trying to set up my Ajax calls. It took me some time to understand how it would call properly. Once I finally got that, then I was able to set that up. I set up 3 Ajax calls, one for each Pokemon.  While doing that, I did wonder about the repeated code I was using. I attempted to consolidate them into one but it wouldn't run.  After giving it half a day's attempt, I left my code as it was and concentrated on other parts of the project.

My next challenge was creating classes and linking the Ajax calls to them so that the Pokemons would be called through the class designated as 'Trainer', rather than directly from the Ajax calls themselves, which they were doing up to this point.  This was extremely trying. It was mostly because I didn't have a good understanding of objects and so I couldn't write out the code. I finally managed to do this only with the assistance of James, our TA.

Since I spent so much time on the code itself, I didn't have much time for the CSS portion.  In order to fulfil the requirements of the project, I utilized a 'card' format for my project from Materialize. I find the various tools on Materialize amazing and will definitely be exploring it further.

I also had to use SCSS and did some basic converting and luckily I didn't have much CSS to begin with, because I hadn't had much time to explore SCSS and I felt I would have spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to use it.

Overall, I felt the project was extremely challenging. I obviously couldn't have completed it with help from a number of my friends.  However, I did get a better understanding of a lot of JavaScript. I know I still will have trouble putting them together but I can but try.
