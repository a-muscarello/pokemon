DESIGN A POKEDEX CHALLENGE

Introduction
This project challenges us to use all the skills we have learned to date and apply it to designing a working pokedex.

Outline
I started by creating a wireframe that would dictate how my page would look like. I amended it multiple times during the course of the project as and when I updated anything. I ended with a very basic wireframe.

Requirements
My version of pokedex were cards that displayed the designated pokemon information. Some of the key requirements were:
    - create at least 3 pokemons with information such as their hp, attack, properties etc.
    - link to the pokemon api to get this information
    - store each pokemon in an object, which has the above-mentioned properties
    - store these objects inb  another object (named your trainer name, in this case 'gunn')
       -  have a method named 'all' that accepts no param and returns an array of pokemon objects
    -  another method named 'get' that accepts a param (name) and returns info on pokemon
    - use ajax call to retrieve the pokemon info
    - have css code in sass
    - use materialize as grid

Challenges
I Googled a lot of information, which was helpful but also received a huge amount of help. It was a true learning project in that I learned how little I knew, yet again.
